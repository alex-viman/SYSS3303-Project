Glitches

1. "Unknown transfer ID" error in Client.java (line ~522)
- After any file transfer, switching to Quiet/Verbose prevents further file transfers.
- packetID sometimes has a hostname prepended to it
- expectedID rarely has a hostname prepended to it
Solution - Strip hostname from this.expectedTID and packetID

Fixed - Client expectedTID is set to Errorsim on any request, hostname are still output

2. ErrorSim receives OOB management packets and displays a notification (calls outputText) - fixed

3. MAJOR - "Unknown transfer ID" packet not working when testSocket has to send to Client
	    Client never receives unknown tid packet 
	    so Data on read, Ack on write, Error from Server dont work for that error
- This works normally when client is on the same computer as errorsim and server
- Possible to workaround in demo otherwise im not sure how to fix this
