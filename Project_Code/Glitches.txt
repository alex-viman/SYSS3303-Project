Glitches

1. "Unknown transfer ID" error in Client.java (line ~522)
- After any file transfer, switching to Quiet/Verbose prevents further file transfers.
- packetID sometimes has a hostname prepended to it
- expectedID rarely has a hostname prepended to it
Solution - Strip hostname from this.expectedTID and packetID

2. ErrorSim receives OOB management packets and displays a notification (calls outputText)
