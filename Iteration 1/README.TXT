  DETAILS - Each .java file has its own documentation.

  This README is for the Iteration 1 submission for the final project.
  Code runs according to the requirements. All files run separately.
  Input sanitization hasn't been implemented, so please be careful when entering file names/paths.

  We added the Working Directory output to the Client.java file to aid us/you when finding files.
  Place your files in the directory to make things easier, for now.

  Test case:
  TFTP Client is running.

  Working Directory = /home/me/IdeaProjects/FinalProject
  Enter file name: L
  Enter full file path: ./L
  Is it a (r)ead or (w)rite?: w
  If this is the last file, enter 'q'. <ENTER>
